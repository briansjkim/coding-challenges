/**
 * A string is a palindrome if it is read the same from forward or backward.
 * 
 * For example, dad reads the same either from forward or backward. So the word dad is a palindrome. Similarly, madam is also a palindrome.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * Doesn't matter if the letters are uppercase or lowercase
 *      A and a are the same
 * Ignore whitespace
 * Ignore symbols
