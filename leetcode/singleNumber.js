// given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one
// Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

// I: non-empty array of integers
// O: Number that isn't repeating
// C: Linear time complexity and No extra memory
// E: [2, 2, 1] => 1; [4, 1, 2, 1, 2] => 4
