//Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

//For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

// Example:
// [-10, -3, 0, 5, 9] => [0, -3, 9, -10, null, 5]

function TreeNode(val) {
  this.val = val;
  this.left = this.right = null;
}
