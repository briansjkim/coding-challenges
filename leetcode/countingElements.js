// given an integer array arr, count element x such that x + 1 is also in arr
// if there are duplicates in arr, count them separately

// Example 1:
// I: arr = [1, 2, 3]
// O: 2
// Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted because 2 and 3 are in arr
// x = 1; 1 + 1 = 2 which is in arr
// x = 2; 2 + 1 = 3 which is in arr
// x = 3; 3 + 1 = 4. not in arr
