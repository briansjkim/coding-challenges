/**
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree
 *
 * Assume a BST is defined as follow:
 *  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key
 *  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
 *  Both the left and right subtree must also be binary search tree
