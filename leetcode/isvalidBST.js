/**
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree
 *
 * Assume a BST is defined as follow:
 *  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key
 *  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
 *  Both the left and right subtree must also be binary search tree
 *
 * Ex 1:
 * I: [2, 1, 3]
 * O: true
 *
 * Ex 2:
 * I: [5, 1, 4, null, null, 3, 6]
 * O: false
 *
 * i: binary tree
 * o: boolean depending on whether the input tree is a BST or not
 * c:
 * e:
