// implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters
// Example:
  // 'aabcccccaa' would become 'a2b1c5a3'
// if the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string
// you can assume the string only uppercase and lowercase letters
