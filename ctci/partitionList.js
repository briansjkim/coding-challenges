// write code to partition a linked list around a value x,
// such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x
// Note: the partition element x can appear anywhere in the 'right partition'; it doesn't need to appear between the left and right partitions

// Example:
// Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1
// Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2    10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
