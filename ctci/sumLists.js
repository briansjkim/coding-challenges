// you have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit
// the digits are stored in REVERSE order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list.
// write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list
// NOTE: Not allowed to 'cheat' and just convert the linked list to an integer

// Examples:
// Input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2) => 617 + 295
// Output: (2 -> 1 -> 9) => 912

// Follow Up
// Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem
// Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5) => 617 + 295
// Output: (9 -> 1 -> 2) => 912
